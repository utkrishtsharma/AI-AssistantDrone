# DroneApplication

Welcome to the DroneApplication repository! This is the complete final year project showcasing a system that integrates a smart UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) with an iOS application. The drone is equipped with advanced features such as face detection, obstacle detection, and voice assistance, all controlled by a Raspberry Pi as the drone's brain.

## Features

- **Smart UAV with Face and Obstacle Detection**: The drone uses a Raspberry Pi for processing and can detect faces and obstacles in real-time.
- **Remote Connectivity**: The iOS app can connect to the drone from anywhere in the world.
- **Voice Assistance**: Control the drone with voice commands via the app.
- **Flight Modes**: Switch between different flight modes for varying operational needs.
- **Flight Path Setting**: Predefine the drone's flight path directly from the app.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Contains the source code for the drone's onboard software and the iOS application.
- `images/` - Contains images related to the project.
- `docs/` - Contains detailed documentation of the project.

## Screenshots
